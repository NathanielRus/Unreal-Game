# Unreal-Game-Project:
### This is the game I developed using Unreal on Azure Devops in 2 weeks:
The goal is to find all the collectables and reach the end.
## Overall Level design:
I used free assets from the Unreal store and also edited assets to create my own ideas.

## Custom Enemy:
The mobs patroling the maze in the fog use sequences to pratrol and on collition damage the player.
