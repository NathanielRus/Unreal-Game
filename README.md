# Unreal-Game-Project:
### This is the game I developed using Unreal on Azure Devops in 2 weeks:
The goal is to find all the collectables and reach the end.
## Overall Level design:
I used free assets from the Unreal store and also edited assets to create my own ideas.

## Custom Enemy:
The mobs patroling the maze in the fog use sequences to pratrol and on collision damage the player.

 ## Player Controls:
 I used Blueprinting for my games operation.

## Puzzle:
I used 3 pressure plates that needed to be pressed all at the same time to open the door. This was accomplished by picking up boxes and placing them on the buttons.
